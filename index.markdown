Hi! I'm a PhD student at the [Faculty of Linguistics](https://www.ling-phil.ox.ac.uk/), [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/) and 
a researcher at the [Center for Information and Language Processing](https://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/), 
[LMU Munich](https://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/). I'm grateful to be co-advised by [Janet Pierrehumbert](http://www.phon.ox.ac.uk/jpierrehumbert/) and 
[Hinrich Sch√ºtze](https://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/schuetze/). My PhD is supported by the [Arts and Humanities Research Council](https://ahrc.ukri.org/) 
and the [German Academic Scholarship Foundation](https://www.studienstiftung.de/en/).

My current research focuses on the link between cognitive and social aspects of language and deep learning models of language.
I'm particularly interested in computational morphology.
